# Traffic-Monitoring-for-Urban-Hospitals

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a real-time system that can count and track vehicles in a hospital's parking lot. By using the video footage from CCTV cameras placed in both outdoor and basement areas, the system will gather important data on parking space occupancy, location, and vehicle arrival times. This will help improve the parking experience for visitors to the hospital.

## Technical Approach
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV, Supervision
- **Deep Learning Framework**: YOLO (You Only Look Once), Ultralytics
- **Text Extraction**: EasyOCR
- **Data Collection**: Pandas
